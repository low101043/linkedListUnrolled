## Unrolled Linked List
This is a Program which implements an unrolled linked list.   In my module Systems Programming in C/C++ I was taught about it through a Zoom tutorial.

Using this will increase performance by having more of the data which will be used on the cache thus increasing the spatial locality and speeding up your program.

# Website
The tutorial used this website: http://opendatastructures.org/ods-java/3_3_SEList_Space_Efficient_.html 

I have tried as much as possible to not use this website and just use the lecture notes (which rarely had any code on it) to try and implement the solution.
